# The project

The app is divided in different controllers, each defined in a separated file.

The connection between index.html and popup.html is implemented via angular object.

In this app we start using Javascript objects to simulate encapsulated data from the server.

## Frontend

The app simulates a videoclub entry panel for an administrator that want to introduce new films and its data to the videoclub store.

The user chooses the type of film to add and the number of films to add, then the app shows a form according to the entered values. When there are no errors in the form clicking add films will open a new popup window showing the introduced data.

## Backend

There is no server side implemented. 

The server data is hardcoded when the application starts.

A popup simulates the data arriving into the server.
